         disconnections or exits by displaying a message to the opponent instead of crashing the game.
        Implemented match-making for players based on room logic in Socket.IO and optimized the server by
         deleting the room after the game ends. The game can end in two scenarios: player disconnection 
         or game end (in a draw or a win). Additional features include displaying the live total player count 
         and disabling user input if it's not the player's turn.
